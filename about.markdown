# Daniel Schleicher

I am a Senior Solutions Architect at AWS, focusing on software-defined cars. In this field, I am interested in applying cloud computing principles for automotive applications, and advancing the software development process of automotive applications utilizing virtualized hardware.

## Areas of Interest

My work and writing focus on several key areas:

- **Automotive Software Development**: Exploring how modern software development practices can be applied to the automotive industry, including the use of AI-powered coding assistants for embedded systems and compliance with standards like ISO 26262, ASPICE, and AUTOSAR.

- **Cloud Computing Architecture**: Understanding and communicating the fundamental differences between cloud-native applications and traditional data center architectures, with a focus on practical implementation patterns.

- **Spec-Driven Development**: Investigating how Large Language Models can participate in software specification and design discussions, helping to reduce ambiguity and establish ubiquitous language in development teams.

- **Virtualization and Infrastructure**: Working with ARM Virtual Hardware, VirtIO, and other virtualization technologies to enable cloud-based development of embedded automotive systems.
